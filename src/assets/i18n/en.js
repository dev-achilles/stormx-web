    'ruleContent' : "1. Participation amount: 1-20ETH, the amount must be an integer, the maximum amount of each account is 20ETH, and it can be repurchase after 6 days. The amount cannot be added when the principal is not thawed. 1-5ETH for Bronze players, 6-14ETH for silver players,15-20ETH for gold players.<br/>2. Static Reward: The reward period is 6 days. After the expiration, the principal will unlock. The user can freely choose to leave or repurchase. The daily interest rate increases with the number of repurchase. After the departure, the number of repurchases is cleared and re-accumulated. .Bronze player’s initial purchase income is 0.2%, 1st repurchase  daily income is 0.25%, 2nd repurchase daily income is 0.3%, 3rd repurchase daily income is 0.35%, 4th repurchase and above Daily income is 0.5%, The silver medal player’s initial purchase income is 0.3%, 1st repurchase daily income is 0.4%, 2nd repurchase daily income is 0.5%, 3rd repurchase daily income is 0.6%, and 4th repurchase and above. Daily income is 0.7%, Gold medal players' initial purchase income is 0.6%, 1st repurchase daily income is 0.7%, 2nd repurchase daily income is 0.8%, 3rd repurchase daily income is 0.9%, 4th repurchase and above Daily income is 1%，Static reward is release at 0:00 (UTC-8) every day, user withdraws at any time. <br/>3. Loyalty Program (not open for the time being): Users can choose to join the Loyalty Program to enjoy higher income when participating. After joining the Loyalty Program, players must re-purchase for 5 rounds (30 days). Bronze players join the loyalty program, the daily income is 0.65%. Silver players join the loyalty program, the daily income is 0.85%. Gold players join the loyalty program with a daily income of 1.2%.<br/>4. Loyalty rewards: Players who repurchase 4th and 4 times, they will share 6% of the current loyalty fund pool and settle at 0:00 (UTC-8) daily.<br/>5. Relay reward: Gold user can enjoy 1% of the static income of 20 people registered before you daily.<br/>6. Node rewards: Bronze user can enjoy 20% of their 1st layer user static bonus. Silver user can enjoy 30% of their 1st layer user static bonus, 20% of 2nd  layer static bonus. Gold players can enjoy 50% of their 1st layer static bonus, 30% of 2nd layer static bonus, 20% of 3rd  layer static bonus, 10% of 4-5th layer static bonus, 5% of 6-10th layer static bonus, 2% of the 11-20th  layer static bonus. Node rewards are issued after a cumulative period (6 days), of which 10% are automatically transferred to the loyalty fund.<br/>7. Reward burn: When the bet amount of the account is less than the recommended friend bet amount, the node reward is calculated based on the amount of the account. If the account amount is greater than or equal to the recommended friend's bet amount, the node reward is calculated based on the recommended friend's bet amount. In addition, the node reward needs to be multiplied by the node level coefficient, the bronze player is 30%, the silver player is 60%, and the gold player is 100%. For example: A recommended B, A bet 5ETH, B bet 15ETH, then A daily bonus is (5*1/100)*50%*30%.<br/>8. Repay mechanism: In order to prevent a small number of speculative users from affecting the game ecology and the interests of a large number of loyal users, the game has set up a strict repay mechanism. Static Consensus Repay Mechanism: User withdraws a certain percentage of the accumulated static reward from his principal to return to the pool of funds when they leave us. 6 times repurchase or below deduction 50% . 7-18 repurchase deduction 40%. 19-36 repurchase deduction 30%. 37 repurchase and above deduction 10% . Dynamic Consensus Mechanism: After the node reward is accumulated for one round (6 days), it must be re-purchased before it can be withdraw. If user choose to leave, the accumulate round node award will return to the funds pool. <br/>9. Consensus Mechanism: When the game fund pool risk is increased to 20%, voting mechanism will be triggered. If passed vote, the principal withdrawal will be suspended (optional re-entry or shelving), and the user who participate during this period will receive 200% of static rewards until the risk returns to normal levels. This mechanism will be triggered entirely by the player through smart contract voting, and the data is fully disclosed on the blockchain, ensuring absolute fairness. <br/>10. Metamorphosis mechanism: 1% of the user's bet amount will be reserved for the last round of bets, up to 500 ETH. In addition, the loss portion will be supplemented with the SCD certificate.<br/>11. Queuing Mechanism: In order to make DAPP ecology healthy and sustainable, Mutual Alliance has set up a queuing mechanism. There are daily limit of participation. The non-admission on the day will be arranged in the waiting queue, during the queuing process can enjoy 0.05% daily interest.",
